- monsters have hard time climbing hills
- space is trying to interact with spells and you can't pick corpses etc.
- sprites can't be interacted with from too short distance
- you can get stuck in fences, I don't know exact vanilla rules, but fences were passable there

**Screenshot**
- arcomage dialogue options too spread out
- skill cost is shown even if you have nothing to learn
- text sometimes crosses interface border
- uv issue, iirc top of crate looked same as side (also 'chest' status msg); other crates also look like this

**Minor minor**
- In vanilla when you pause game by holding rightclick, status hints are shown when you mouse over for example barrels. In OE, they don't appear
- When you avoid disease from trash heaps with repair item, status message and overlay flash still appear
