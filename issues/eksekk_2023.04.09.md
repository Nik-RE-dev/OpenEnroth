**Major**
- [???] it seems that torch light doesn't work outdoors EDIT: nevermind, it triggers at exact time, which should nonetheless probably be changed to earlier
- [???] It's impossible to "climb hills". While that may be intended, it changes gameplay significantly so goes into this section
- [???] it's very hard to hit trees (from tularean forest) in melee, as well as pick up their "corpses"
 
**Minor**
- [Fix: OpenEnroth#670] in vanilla resting on snow required I believe 4 food, and in OE when there is winter and grass turns into snow still only 1 is required
- [New issue: OpenEnroth#663] can't switch in chest to inventory of player unable to act (of course selection should jump to anyone active or disappear upon closing, but managing inventory should be possible)
again encountered that chest items appearing suddenly thing, this time with two shields
- [New issue: OpenEnroth#659] character facial expressions stop when pulling up menu (load, save, exit etc.). Don't know if that's vanilla-like, but not only they don't happen anymore, characters' faces freeze mid-expression - that is definitely a bug
- [Vanilla also changes color of mastery to red] when your mastery is greater than novice and you mouse over skill name, mastery changes color too, in vanilla it was immune I think
 
**Minor minor**
- [???] vanilla bug: harmondale accuracy well is broken (clicking does nothing, only spacebar works). Maybe event assigned to wrong facets?
